# Source Map

This is a benchmark for the [source-map](https://github.com/mozilla/source-map)
package, both serializing and parsing the `source-map.min.js.map` that ships
with the package.

Both the `source-map.js` file is taken from the `source-map` distribution at
commit [eb182f0](https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/tree/eb182f0) and is
subject to the
[LICENSE](https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/blob/master/LICENSE) of the
upstream package.
